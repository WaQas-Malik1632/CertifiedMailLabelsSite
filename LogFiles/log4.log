We call it a ‘label’ but it is just a plain sheet of paper that prints on your color printer. It is designed to be folded and glued onto the outside of your envelope. You may also purchase our approved USPS Certified Mail Envelopes and print on just a black ink laser printer for automated mailings. Nothing to glue, tape, or affix. This envelope contains the green USPS Certified Mail banner and large cellophane window so that USPS barcode readers can easily sort and process the Certified Mail as an automated transaction for expedited delivery.

You can pay for the postage label after you select the postage weight and USPS delivery services you want. We accept all major banks and credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, AMX, Discover), paper checks, eChecks, and bank wires. You can also set up Auto Invoicing to replenish your postage account. Every time a label is purchased it deducts that cost from your online account balance. New customers needing to purchase more than $25 in postage daily should verify their accounts. This verification is done on the phone and takes about 3 minutes. It helps protect your Credit Card and will allow you to add $100, $250, $500, or more onto your account.
